Field Notes
===========
Some random notes that could be useful to others
If you want to tell me something, use the project issues.


OnShape
=======

* OnShape is quite slow, the more I work, the slower it gets, reloading the page will help for a while.
* I try to split the history across multiple part studio, otherwise I get lost, same for assemblies, it gets messy quickly. 
I can't move a part to a different studio so it's a pain. Even simple parts get a messy history once chamfered and mating 
connectors defined. I regret every time I have put 2 parts in the same studio (but I can't send a part 
to its own studio, so sometimes laziness take over).
* I name things (at least solids and part studios), maybe hungarian would help for features.
* Importing sketches is a trap, because I can't manage dependencies afterwards, and I can't hide it. Maybe reused sketches 
should be minimalistic.
* Using arrays in sketches is a trap, we can't edit their history and I *always* want to edit an array history.
They got it backards, we rarely want to edit the number of instances in an array, but we almost always want to edit what 
will get cloned. I always favor the solid array function (I don't know if we can always use it).
* trying to use many constraints in sketches is a bit dangerous, because managing the constraints is difficult, the 
visualisaiton is not really effective.
* Mate connectors are a pain, the snapping doesn't work well (or is too slow which is like not working), and they clog 
the model history. I name connectors, otherwise the assembly becomes even more complicated.
* Interestingly enough, 123D Design (a native app) is not faster on my machine. Are they all so rich that they develop 
only on high end hardware?
* An interesting idea to prepare the models for CNC is to use assemblies. Modeling a table and using fastened or planar 
matings to layout the parts before CNC'ing them, it could be ok for 3D printing too, I guess.

Vacuum Pump
===========

* I use the cheapest cooking pot I could find in the Arab quarter as the vessel.
* The seal is made with a silicon cake pan pierced in the center (it all began when I brought a quiche at an heavily 
alcoholized potluck party).
* the lid is a sheet of transparent polystyrene from the hardware store, hot glue seems to work as a selant for fittings.
* the rest (pump, gauge, etc) is off of ebay
* I cracked the lid when toying with acetone in vacuum, I don't know if the vapor got it or if a drop jumped up when 
opening the valve to release the vacuum.
* I had no success in trying to degas [scultoline](http://www.malicorshop.com/produits/8-la-scultoline.html) even under 
vaccum in a melted state.
* Dan Gelbart has a very interesting vacuum suction idea [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMP_AfiNlX4) vacuuming 
the air from the mold first, then using the void to pull the molding material in the mold.
